HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used on the frontend and gives the structure to the webpage which you can style using CSS and make interactive using JavaScript.



## W3Schools: Learn HTML
- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document.
- The `<html>` element is the root element of an HTML page.
- The `<head>` element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab).
- The `<body>` element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, list, etc.
- The `<h1>` element defines a large heading.
- The `<p>` element defines paragraph.

**What is an HTML Element?**
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

`<tagname>`Content goes here... `</tagname>`

The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

`<h1>`My First Heading`</h1>`
`<p>`My first paragraph.`</p>`

## MDN Docs: Getting started with HTML

**Nesting elements:**
Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called *nesting*. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word 'very' in a `<strong>` element, which means that the word is to have strong(er) text formatting:

`<p>`My cat is `<strong>`very`</strong>` grumpy.`<p>`

**Void elements:**
Not all elements follow the pattern of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag, content, and a closing tag. Some elements consist of a single tag, which is typically used to insert/embed something in the document. Such elements are called [[Void elements]]. For example, the `<img>` element embeds an image file onto a page:

`<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png" alt="Firefox icon" />`

**Attributes:**
![[Pasted image 20230913205454.png]]
Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. in this example, the class attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with style information.

**An attribute should have:**
- A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by space too.)
- The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.
- An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.


## Active learning: Adding attributes to an element

Another example of an element is `<a>`. This stands for *anchor*. an anchor can make the text it enclose into a hyperlink. Anchors can take a number of attributes, but several are as follows:

**href**

This attribute's value specifies the web address for the link. for example: `href="https://www.mozilla.org/"`.

**title**

The title attribute specifies extra information bout the link, such as a description of the page that is being linked to. For example, `title="The Mozilla homepage"`. This appears as a tooltip when a cursor hovers over the element.

**Target**

The target attribute specifies the browsing context used to display the link. For example, `target="_blank"` will display the link in a new tab. If you want to display the linked content in the current tab, just omit this attribute.

Edit the line below in the *Input* area to rune it into a link to your favorite website.

1. Add the `<a>` element.
2. Add the `href` attribute and the `title` attribute.
3. Specify the `target` attribute to open the link in the new tab.

You will be able to see your changes live in the *Output* area. You should see a link - that when hovered over - display the value of the `title` attribute and, when clicked, opens a new tab and navigates to the web address in the `href` attribute. Remember that you need to include a space between the element name and between each attribute.

`<p>A link to my <a href="https://mozilla.org" title="The Mozilla homepage" target="_blank">Favorite Website</a>.</p>`
## Boolean attributes

Sometimes you will see attributes written without values. This is entirely acceptable. This are called Boolean attributes. Boolean attributes can only have one value, which is generally the same as the attribute name.  For example, consider the `disable` attribute, which you can assign to form input elements. (You use this to *disable* the form input elements so the user can't make entries. The disable elements typically have a grayed-out appearance.) For example:

`<input type="text" disabled="disabled" />`

As shorthand, it is acceptable to write this as follows:

`<!-- using the disabled attribute prevents the end user from entering text into the input box -->`
`<input type="text" disabled />`

`<!-- text input is allowed, as it doesn't contain the disabled attribute -->`
`<input type="text" />`



## Omitting quotes around attribute values 

If you look at code for a lot of other sites, you might come across a number of strange markup styles, including attribute values without quotes. This is permitted in certain circumstances, but it can also break your markup in other circumstances. For example, if we revisit our link example from earlier, we could write a basic version with only the `href` attribute, like this:

`<a href=https://www.mozila.org/>favorite wewbsite</a>`

However, as soon as we add the `title` attribute in this way, there are problems:

`<a href=https://www.mozilla.org/ title=The Mozilla homepage>favorite website</a>`

As written above, the browser misinterpret the markup, mistaking the `title` attribute for three attribute: a title attribute with the value `the`, and two Boolean attributes, `Mozilla` and `homepage`. Always include the attribute quates. It avoids such problems, and results in more readable. 

## Single or double quotes?

In this article, you will also notice that the attributes are wrapped in double quotes. However, you might see single quotes in some HTML code. this is a matter of style. You can feel free to choose which one you prefer. Both of these lines are equivalent:

`<a href='https://www.example.com'>A link to my example.</a>`

`<a href="https://www.example.com">A link to my example.</a>`

make sure you don't mix single quotes and double quotes.

However, if you use one type of quote, you can include the other type of quote _inside_ your attribute values:

`<a href="https://www.example.com" title="Isn't this fun?">A link to my example.</a>`

## Anatomy of an HTML document

Individual HTML elements aren't very useful on their own. Next, let's examine how individual elements combine to form an entire HTML page:
