// Exercise #1
// Write a function that takes two numbers and returns the maximum of the two.

// Exercise #2
// Write a function that determines if a object is on portrait or landscape mode.

// Exercise #3
// Write a function that will take a number and return the FizzBuzz of that number.
// If the number is divisible by 3 return Fizz
// If the number is divisible by 5 return Buzz
// If the number is divisible by 3 and 5 return FizzBuzz
// If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5 return the number
// If the number is not a number return NaN

// Exercise #4
// Write a function called checkSpeed that takes a speed as an argument.
// If the speed is less than 70 return OK
// If the speed is more than 70 add 5 points to the speed for every 1km/h over the limit.
// If the speed is more than 70 and the points are more than 12 return License Suspended

// Exercise #5
// Write a function that take an array of numbers as an argument and  determines if a number is ODD or EVEN.

// Exercise #6
// Write a function that take an array and returns and counts the truthy values in the array.
// Falsy values are: false, 0, '', null, undefined, NaN
// Truthy values are: true, 1, 'a', [], {}, 'false'
// Example: countTruthy([0, null, '', 'Hello', 1, 2, 3]) => 4

// Exercise #7
// Write a function that take an object as an argument and display only the properties with the type string.
// Example: showProperties({name: 'John', age: 30, address: '123 Main St'}) => name, address

// Exercise #8
// Write a function that take an array of numbers as an argument and returns the sum of the multiples of 3 and 5.
// Multiples of 3 => 3, 6, 9
// Multiples of 5 => 5, 10

// Exercise #9
// Write a function called calculateGrade that takes an array of marks as an argument and returns the average of the marks.
// If the average is less than 60 return F
// If the average is less than 70 return D
// If the average is less than 80 return C
// If the average is less than 90 return B
// If the average is less than 100 return A
// Example: calculateGrade([80, 80, 50]) => C

// Exercise #10
// Write a function called showStars that takes a number as an argument and display a triangle of stars.

// Exercise #11
// Write a function called showPrimes that takes a number as an argument and display all the prime numbers less than or equal to that number.
// Example: showPrimes(20) => 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19
// A prime number is a number that is divisible only by itself and 1.
// Example: 2 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 2.
// Example: 4 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 1, 2, and 4.
